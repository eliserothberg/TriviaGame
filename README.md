State Law Trivia Game

Multiple choice trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
When the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option with a relevant gif appears. If time runs out or a wrong answer is selected, a screen telling them so, with the correct answer and a gif appears. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed, all without user input.
The final screen shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

All answer options are illegal in at least one American state.
